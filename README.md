Women account for 85 percent of all purchases and drive 70-80 percent of all consumer spending. -Jana Matthews Professor and director of the Australian Centre for Business Growth, University of South Australia Yet between "94 and 99 per cent of women in abusive relationships have been subjected to some form of financial abuse", unable to handle their own money, forced to accept terrible credit scores and assume debts they aren't responsible for.  Abusers take total control of the household finances and keep women "in the dark about the familyâ€™s assets and liabilities and unable to access or open bank accounts". This webpage exists with login credentials accompanied by a username. A shorter password takes you to a webpage with regular posts on women's health (information about menstruation, menopause, breast cancer, bacterial vaginosis, breastfeeding etc.) &amp; the ability to ask women for women's health advice. Signing in with the same username but a longer password reveals a hidden layer of the website where women can access a support network of other women experiencing financial and other forms of abuse, easily connect with resources to help them sort out their financials  &amp; budget successfully without their abuser knowing, as well as access help from trained professionals to help them leave their abusive relationship.
